# Running
Run `docker-composer -up` and access `http://localhost:8080`.

> NOTE: The container will run with user `www-data`, that is a non-root user, if you need access the container as root run `docker exec -u 0 -it php-fpm sh`.

# New Relic
To enable *New Relic* Agent, you must pass set the env `NEWRELIC_ENABLED` and `NEWRELIC_LICENSE`. Other params is also available, check the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/petronetto/php7-alpine/blob/master/php-fpm/Dockerfile) for more details.  


# Remote debug

The container is configured to run the file that bootstrap applications in folder `/app/public`, because I use Laravel/Lumen by default, so, if you don't use a framework that bootstrap the application in this folder, you must put your source files there.
To the debug works, you must:

1) Set your local IP address in `XDEBUG_HOST` environment variable in `docker-compose.yml`.

2) Configure your editor/IDE to map the local source and the remote source.

## IDE/Editor configuration

You need configure your editor/IDE to map the local source and where is the remote source.

### VS Code
Install [PHP Debug Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-debug).

Put this config in your `launch.json`:

>**NOTE** this example will map the local folder app, to `/app` on the container. Remenber that container is configured to boostrap in `/app/public`, as the example provided in this repo

```json
//launch.json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "XDebug",
            "type": "php",
            "request": "launch",
            "port": 9000,
            "pathMappings": {
                "/app": "${workspaceRoot}"
            },
            "ignore": ["**/vendor/**/*.php"]
        }
    ]
}
```


## Sublime Text

Install [XDebug Client](https://github.com/martomo/SublimeTextXdebug)

Create a sublime-project in `Project > Save Project As...`

Paste the config as bellow in created file, and ensure that `path_mapping` is mapping the **full** path to your source, eg: `C:\my\source`, `/Users/user/my/source`, `/home/user/source`, etc...:

```json
{
  "folders": [
    {
      "follow_symlinks": true,
      "path": "."
    }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "xdebug": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080",
      "path_mapping": {
        "/app" : "/full/path/to/your/source"
      }
    }
  }
}
```


## Atom

Intall [this extension](https://github.com/gwomacks/php-debug), go to `Settings > Open Config Folder` and put in your `config.cson`:

```
"php-debug":
    PathMaps: [
      "remotepath;localpath"
      "/app;/path/to/your/local/source"
    ]
```


## PHPStorn
